# nodejs-pgpromise
A tutorial on using pg-promise in Node.js. The demo will use an OpenWeatherMap API to pull weather forecasts from locations in a table. Two steps will need to be done for the demo to work. 
  
**Step #1**  
Create a .env file in the root of the folder with the below format. 
  
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1  
DB_PORT=5432  
DB_DATABASE=  
DB_USER=  
DB_PASSWORD=  
OPENWEATHER_API=  
  
**Step #2**  
Sign up for a free API at OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).
